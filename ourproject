                Our Microsoft Practicum Project develops a novel approach to analyzing earnings call transcripts 
                through advanced sentiment analysis and correlating the results with stock price movements.
                
                The project addresses a crucial gap in financial analysis by automating the extraction of sentiment 
                signals from earnings calls and quantifying their relationship with market movements. Using natural 
                language processing and machine learning techniques, we've built a system that can:
                
                1. Process raw earnings call transcripts
                2. Identify sentiment patterns across different segments of the call
                3. Correlate these patterns with short and medium-term stock price changes
                4. Visualize the results for intuitive understanding
                
                Our analysis demonstrates significant predictive power of sentiment in earnings calls on short-term 
                stock movements, with an accuracy of 78% for next-day price direction.

                Earnings calls contain valuable information that can predict stock price movements, but:
                
                1. **Manual Analysis is Impractical**: 
                   - Thousands of earnings calls occur each quarter
                   - Manual analysis is time-consuming and subjective
                   - Analysts can only cover a small fraction of available calls
                
                2. **Traditional Sentiment Analysis is Insufficient**:
                   - Generic sentiment tools fail to capture financial nuance
                   - Financial terminology has domain-specific sentiment implications
                   - Context matters greatly in interpreting management statements
                
                3. **Relationship Between Sentiment and Stock Movement is Complex**:
                   - Not all positive/negative language affects stock prices equally
                   - Timing of statements within calls affects market impact
                   - Speaker roles (CEO vs CFO) have different market influence
                
                Our project addresses these challenges through specialized NLP models and correlation analysis
                designed specifically for the financial domain and earnings call context.
